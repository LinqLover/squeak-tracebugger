A lightweight and efficient back-in-time debugger for [Squeak](http://squeak.org/) to trace and retrace past method invocations and state changes.
Powered by [SimulationStudio](https://github.com/LinqLover/SimulationStudio).

Key features:

- **Interactive call tree** instead of a stack list
- **Step back button**
- **New navigation shortcuts** (jump to sender, jump to callee, ...)
- **Context search** dialog
- **Context filters** (by package, selector, receiver, ...)
- **Snapshot inspectors/explorers** for objects during debugging

Read the [expos√© and the product visions](./docs/) for more details about the aims and USPs of this project.
In the [`studies`](./studies/) folders, you can also find the documentation of all experiments that have been conducted so far.
There are many open interesting [issues](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger/issues) for future work.

## Installation

We offer a pre-configured all-in-one image. Please go to the [releases section](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger/releases), download and extract the latest `TraceDebugger-*.zip` archive, and execute it.

To install the TraceDebugger manually, evaluate the following in a workspace:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
	baseline: 'TraceDebugger';
	repository: 'github://hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger';
	get;
	load.
```

You can also check out the repository via [Squot](https://github.com/hpi-swa/Squot) and install all dependencies manually.

To install updates, evaluate the following:

```smalltalk
TraceDebugger selfUpdate.
```

(You can also do this via the [window menu ![window menu](./assets/windowMenuButton.png)](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger/blob/gh-pages/screenshots/windowMenu.png) of every trace debugger.)

## Usage

For a quick start, open a normal expression in a debugger and press the new <kbd>Trace it</kbd> button on the right. For a detailed manual on the TraceDebugger, please read the in-image help here:

```smalltalk
TraceDebuggerHelp openHelpBrowser.
```

(Again, you can also open this help via the [window menu ![window menu](./assets/windowMenuButton.png)](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger/blob/gh-pages/screenshots/windowMenu.png) of every trace debugger.)
