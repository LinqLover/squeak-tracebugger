These special kernel tests test the interplay between tracing simulator and retracing simulators. During tracing of the test execution, periodical snapshots of the current context are taken and stored, and after the execution has been completed, the snapshots for the relevant contexts are re-created using both point and range retracing simulators and compared to the original snapshots. Somewhere between integration tests and smoke tests.
