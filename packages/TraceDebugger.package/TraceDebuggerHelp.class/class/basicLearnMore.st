To learn more about the project and further plans about the protoype, please visit the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger

In particular, there are many open issues:

	https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/squeak-tracedebugger/issues

To dive into the implementation details, in addition to the package overview on GitHub, some good starting points might be the class comments in TraceDebugger and TDBCursor.

If you have any feedback or ideas, please let me know and drop an issue!! You can also do this directly via the window menu of the trace debugger. By the way, it is also possible from there to update your installed version or perform some special process-related operations. Last not least, you can also check out some experimental preferences from there.
