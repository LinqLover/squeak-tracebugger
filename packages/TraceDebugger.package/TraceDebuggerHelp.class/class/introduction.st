'Welcome to TraceDebugger

The TraceDebugger is a lightweight and efficient back-in-time debugger for Squeak to trace and retrace past method invocations and state changes. Key features include:

- Interactive call tree instead of a stack list
- Step back button
- New navigation shortcuts (jump to sender, jump to callee, ...)
- Context search dialog
- Context filters (by package, selector, receiver, ...)
- Snapshot inspectors/explorers for objects during debugging

To get started, open a trace debugger or browse all examples.!
