'Context filters

Another option to reduce the displayed complexity of the program trace is provided by context filters that hide irrelevant portions of the trace from the tree. To add a context filter, select an undesired context in the tree, yellow-click it, and choose "add filters". You can now add a filter by example, for instance, by hiding all contexts with a selector like the selected one, hiding all contexts from the same package, or all contexts that have the same receiver.

<#figureContextAddFilter>

To revise the list of contexts, or to add a context without an example, do a yellow-click on the context tree (or just hover it and press escape) and choose "edit filters". Here you can select a filter type and choose all items that should be hidden from the trace.!
