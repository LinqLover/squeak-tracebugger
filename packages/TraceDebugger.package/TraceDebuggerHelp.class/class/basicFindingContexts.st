'Finding Contexts

Via the context tree menu, you can also search for contexts and quickly jump to them. To do so, select the context beneath which the search should start and choose "find context" or "find class" from the yellow button menu. You can also use cmd + f resp. cmd + g for this. From the dialog, select the desired pattern, i.e. the signature of the context or its method class, and accept.

With "find context again" (cmd + shift + f) resp. "find class again" (cmd + shift + g), you can jump to the next hit without specifying the search pattern again.
