I am the help book for the TraceDebugger. In particular, I implement a template mechanism that allows authors to insert <#figureSelector> patterns in the basic page topics. These selectors will be resolved when opening the book to insert dynamically generated figures into the text.

For editing the help templates, authors should send #openHelpBrowserForEdit.
