I represent an earlier state of a traced object at a given time index that has been recorded in a memory. As a proxy, I wrap around this object and forward all messages transparently to it. All forwarded messages are simulated using a TDBRetracingSimulator to emulate the virtual historic state space. All complex returned objects are wrapped into further proxies to preserve the historic state over message chains. To break out of the proxy space, send #tdbproxyYourself.
