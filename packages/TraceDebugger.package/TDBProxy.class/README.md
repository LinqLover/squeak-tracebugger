I represent an earlier state of a traced object at a given time index that has been recorded in a memory. As a proxy, I wrap around this object and forward all messages transparently to it. All forwarded messages are simulated using a TDBRetracingSimulator to emulate the virtual historic state. Note that any side effects from forwarded messages will be isolated from the rest image and only appear in follow-up messages to the message result. All complex returned objects are wrapped into further proxies to preserve the historic state over message chains. To apply multiple message sends within the same side-effect space, compose them into a single #in: message. To break out of the proxy space, send #tdbproxyYourself.

I also carry along some side effects that were captured while retrieving the proxy from a memory and transforming it, and that will be passed on to any derived proxies.
