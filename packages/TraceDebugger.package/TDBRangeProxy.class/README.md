I represent an earlier state of a traced object at a given time RANGE that has been recorded in a memory. Just as my superclass, I act as a transparent proxy, forward all messages using an isolating TDBRangeRetracingSimulator to emulate the virtual historic state, and answer a new range proxy for each complex return value. However, retracing a forwarded message may fray out when it accesses further states that vary within the time range. In this case, a TDBRetracingFrayOut error is signaled.

The time range is stored as an Interval in the variable timeIndex which holds a single Integer in the superclass.
